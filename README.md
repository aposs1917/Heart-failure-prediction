# Heart-failure-prediction

Data taken from #https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction. 

# Algorithms used
This is a supervised learning task. For this reason a decision tree , a non-linear support vector machine, a logistig regression and a neural network binary classifier we used.
All model's heperparameters were optimized with randomized search. 

# Results
The focus was on recall (since a low recall would mean that patients are wrongly classified as healthy). A 90% recall score was reached using a decision tree and a neural network classifier.
